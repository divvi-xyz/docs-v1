# Funding rewards

Divvi implements reward funding (_e.g._, rewarding builders for bringing incremental
TVL) using Divvi Rewards Pools. A user responsible for managing rewards for a
specific project (_e.g._, an ecosystem grant manager) funds a Reward Pool and
defines the metric for distributing rewards.

## Creating a Reward Pool

To create a new Reward Pool you will need to decide on:

1. A chain to deploy the Reward Pool on
1. A token
1. A KPI
1. A withdrawal timelock
1. A management wallet (_e.g._, multisig) to manage the Reward Pool

### Deploying a Reward Pool

> The Divvi team is working on a custom dapp for deploying new Reward Pools.

Ask the Divvi team to deploy a new Reward Pool contract using the information
above.

### Funding a Reward Pool

> The Divvi team is working on a custom dapp for managing Reward Pools.

You can fund a Reward Pool by calling deposit on the Reward Pool contract with your
management wallet. You can do this directly through the Safe UI if you're using a
Safe multisig.
