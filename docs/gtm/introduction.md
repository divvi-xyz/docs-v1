# INTRODUCTION

The goal of this document is to support you in identifying and building a go-to-market (GTM) strategy for your new app built on Mobile Stack. In each section, you’ll work through a set of exercises to help you prepare for your product launch. The document is divided into three sections:

- **Positioning**
- **GTM Strategy**
- **Execution**

To reiterate, this playbook provides a framework to help you discover how to best promote your app; it does not give you something to just copy and paste. Each project, app, and its audience are unique. If you were all the same, there would be no need for most of you (the market hates redundancies). Therefore, what you create from the Mobile Stack GTM Playbook will be unique to your product, your organization, and your users.

No part of this process is static. Successful projects constantly evolve as they learn more about themselves, their users, and the market. As you work through the playbook, don’t hesitate to revisit sections, modify, or expand on your answers. And don’t be afraid of “getting it wrong.” The purpose of this is to give you a starting point to launch (i.e., take your app to market), learn, and iterate.
