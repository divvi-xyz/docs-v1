# Divvi Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our Divvi community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to create a welcoming, friendly, and encouraging community environment, please let us know.

## 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed at another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory content, jokes, and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Recording and photography without consent.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in-person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks, and presentations.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible via [Discord](https://discord.gg/EaxZDhMuDn).

## 7. Scope
We expect all community participants (staff, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues: online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
