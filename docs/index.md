# Introduction

Divvi is a permissionless protocol orchestration layer to automatically divvy up protocol revenue with app builders who drive adoption and user interaction through innovative UX.

Divvi's revenue-sharing model directly aligns incentives between protocols and builders and enforces them as rewards in contract code for any onchain ecosystem â€“ so protocols can define the value they want to measure, and builders can automatically earn based on impact.

The Divvi Mobile Framework also provides a self-custody app infrastructure to help build native mobile UX in weeks rather than months.
