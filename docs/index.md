# Introduction

Divvi is a blockchain-based protocol that makes it easy to align incentives among participants in on-chain ecosystems. Participants define objective functions — such as product-specific KPIs — and set rewards for improving these values. Participants collaborate to maximize objective functions and earn rewards for on-chain impact.
