# Introduction

Divvi is a permissionless orchestration layer built to automatically divvy up earnings derived from referred users between app builders (referrers) and web3 protocols (backend protocools).

Divviâ€™s revenue-sharing model directly aligns incentives between protocols and builders who drive adoption and user interaction through innovative UX, and enforces them as rewards in contract code for any onchain ecosystem. Protocols can define the value they want to measure as proof-of-impact, and builders can automatically earn based on they value they bring onchain in the form of referred TVL, transaction volume, network fees, etc.

The Divvi Mobile Framework also provides a self-custody app infrastructure to help build native mobile UX in weeks rather than months.
