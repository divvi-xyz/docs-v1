## WHO on your team should start the process?

An officer at your organization (or anyone with legal signing authority) should go through the initial setup, as they will need to complete KYC using a Government-issued ID. Once the account is set up, other members of your team will be able to contribute or take the lead.

## WHAT you'll need

A traditional Google account using your business email account. Make sure you have created an account at https://accounts.google.com/SignUp

- **[A D‑U‑N‑S® Number](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312?hl=en)** for your organization
- **Headquarters address & phone number**, which will be published online.
- **A phone number & email address** for your individual developer profile
- **A contact phone number and email address** for your organization's Google account

## WHEN: Timeline

**Please apply as soon you start building. The goal is to avoid delays in publishing and getting your Divvi app live.**

*Tip*: Applying through Apple is free and includes faster processing. Please apply at this [link](https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/#!/search).

Alternatively, apply directly to Duns & Bradstreet for your DUNS number.

- In the U.S.? [Get your D-U-N-S® Number here](https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html).

- Outside of the U.S.? Please [contact your local Duns & Bradstreet office](https://www.dnb.com/utility-pages/global-customer-service-centers.html)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Google Developer Account (~10 min)

Visit https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/ and log in with your Google Login.

- Under organization type, choose “a company or business”
- Continue filling in the prompts
- Continue until finalizing the $25 payment

**You should receive a confirmation email that your verification is in process (24-48 hrs).**

## Step 2: Once verification is complete (~15 min)

### [Verify your website](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13205715?sjid=14760582666064445422-NA) using Google Search Console

Additionally, visit the [Play console](https://play.google.com/console) for a notification about pending website verification. Click on that. The following screen has a button to send the verification request to the site owner

Have the site owner receive and approve the verification request

### Create a [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/signup/tos)

#### Add members to the project:

- Go to the [API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)

- Open the console’s left-side menu and select "IAM & Admin"

- From the project list (top left, to the right of their logo), choose the project to which you want to add a member

- Click Grant Access and provide an email address. Each user should be an editor


#### Enable Google Play API services:

- Go [here](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/5802422777801763452/app-list?pli=1)
- In the left column, under “Setup”, click “API access”
- Confirm any notes as appropriate
- Click “View” on Google Cloud Platform
- Click “View All Products”
- Under Management, Choose “API & Service”
- Enable API & Services
- Turn on Google Play Android Developer API if you have not already


## Step 3: Set up your app

It’s time to set up your app. After inviting your key engineers to the project(s), the team will need to create the app, set up release track(s), and set the store listing and policies, and choose which countries to publish to.

You will need the [required assets](https://docs.divvi.xyz/publishing/asset-requirements) to complete the setup.
