# Divvi Builder Camp
Are you building onchain apps and looking for sustainable funding?
Join the Divvi Builder Camp and get rewarded for the value you help create onchain! No applications. No waiting period.
Just plug into the Divvi Protocol and start building. When your app drives onchain impact (i.e. incremental value) for the backend protocol you build on, Divvi will measure that impact‚Äîand pay you builder rewards weekly.


### Requirements

2. **Join our community**: Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EaxZDhMuDn) to get in touch with the Divvi Team, attend office hours or find like-minded builders to team up with.
3. **Build on Divvi**: Build a web or mobile app that drives users and value onchain, integrate the Divvi Protocol V0, and one or several of our featured backend protocols.
3. **Launch your product**: Take your innovative UX to market and start onboarding users.
4. **Drive value & receive incentives**: Start receiving weekly rewards for the value you deliver onchain based on the metric(s) identified as proof-of-impact for the protocol you choose to integrate.
5. **Continue growth**: Unlock a steady flow of revenue.
