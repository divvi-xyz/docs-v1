# Divvi Builder Camp
Are you building onchain apps? Joing the Divvi Builder Camp and get rewarded for the value you bring onchain! No applications. No waiting period. Just fill out the [Divvi Protocol Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mPrrd6VxcJezenu7_zALkNSCQ8JJTQHnWPURo_CrL6c/edit) to plug into the Divvi Protocol and start building. If your app drives verifiable impact (incremental earnings) for the backend protocol you choose to integrate via Divvi, the orchestration layer will measure that value—and reward it weekly.
