# Overview

Divvi Mobile enables builders to create web3 mobile apps that integrate with blockchain protocols—without having to worry about how users will access them. Every blockchain app needs a way for users to interact with protocols, but requiring users to bring their own wallet can create friction.

Divvi Mobile solves this by providing built-in wallet functionality to streamline onboarding and transactions. Instead of spending time on wallet infrastructure, builders can focus on what makes their app unique while ensuring users have a seamless experience.

## Why Use Divvi Mobile?
