# Overview

Divv Mobile Framework is a set of software SDKs and services that
helps web3 builders implement and deliver native mobile experiences to
end-users. Mobile Framework aims to support:

- Application developers, by providing SDKs that help you quickly
  build a native mobile application with all the experiences your
  users might expect on mobile (e.g., swapping, cash-in, cash-out,
  asset management, yield earning, etc.).
- Protocol developers, by providing easy ways to plug your protocol
  into Mobile Framework so application developers can integrate it into
  their end-user experiences.
- Go-to-market teams, by providing tools to launch and manage
  go-to-market campaigns to onboard new users.
